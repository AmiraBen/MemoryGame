# Memory Game Project

# Preview
This game is about matching similiar cards. It is implemented using plain javascript. I used click event listeners to add functionality to the cards when they are clicked and added the logic for each card. Also the game includes scores and timers. Plus I made use of an external js libary for showing alerts.
